            "Horses have excellent senses, particularly their vision and hearing. They have a wide field of vision due to their eye placement and can see almost 360 degrees around them.",
            "Horses are highly social creatures and often form strong bonds with other horses. They communicate through body language, vocalizations, and even facial expressions.",
            "Horses are built for speed and can run at speeds of up to 55 miles per hour. The fastest recorded sprinting speed of a horse is 55 mph.",
            "Horses can live for 25 to 30 years on average, with some even reaching their 40s. The oldest recorded horse lived to be 62 years old.",
