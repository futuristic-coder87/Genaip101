            "Horses have four natural gaits: walk, trot, canter, and gallop. Some breeds, like the Icelandic horse, have additional gaits such as the tÃ¶lt and pace.",
            "Horses have excellent senses, particularly their vision and hearing. They have a wide field of vision due to their eye placement and can see almost 360 degrees around them.",
            "Horses are highly social creatures and often form strong bonds with other horses. They communicate through body language, vocalizations, and even facial expressions.",
            "Horses are built for speed and can run at speeds of up to 55 miles per hour. The fastest recorded sprinting speed of a horse is 55 mph.",
            "Horses can live for 25 to 30 years on average, with some even reaching their 40s. The oldest recorded horse lived to be 62 years old.",
            "Horses have a one-way digestive system, meaning they cannot vomit. This makes them susceptible to colic, a potentially life-threatening condition.",
            "A horse's hooves are constantly growing, similar to human fingernails. Regular trimming is necessary to maintain hoof health and prevent discomfort.",
            "Horses have excellent memories and can remember people and places for years. They are also intelligent animals capable of learning complex tasks and commands."
